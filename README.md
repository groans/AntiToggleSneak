# AntiToggleSneak
Disable unfair ToggleSneak advantages, such as chatting while shifted, opening containers while shifted, and modifying containers while shifted. Supports four modes (silent, verbal, kick, and ban).

If you are using this, please note that in newer versions (1.15+), toggle sneaking is built into the game, so I would not use this plugin if you are fine with this.
